# dosgato-templating
A library to support building templates for dosgato CMS.

This library provides types and classes necessary to provide structure to the
process of building a new template. The rendering server, API, and Admin UI will depend
on this structure to accomplish their work.

For now, see the code for comments on how it all works.
